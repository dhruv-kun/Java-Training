	 * Let us design a simple compression algorithm where only the frequency of
	 * individual letters is used to compress the data. For e.g., the string
	 * Aabcccccaaa would become a2b1c5a3. The compression logic should be
	 * applied only when the total length of the compressed string is less than
	 * the original string. For the purpose of compression logic, the case
	 * sensitiveness is not considered. For e.g. A and a are considered the
	 * same.

	 * @param input
	 *            A String that needs to be compressed is given. Given string
	 *            always contains characters. The string may contain characters
	 *            in upper as well as lower case.
	 * @return Output is the compressed string or the same string if the
	 *         compressed string length is more than or equal to the length of
	 *         the original string. Output contains string in lowercase always.
